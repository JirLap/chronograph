## Features

* Self-explanatory flow cards for easy integration of timers and stopwatches in your home automation,
* Create timers and stopwatches directly from flow cards, no need for a prior configuration,
* Start timers with a duration in milliseconds (fractional seconds), seconds, minutes, hours or days,
* Start stopwatches without a predefined end time,
* Trigger flows at exact timer- or stopwatch durations with millisecond (fractional seconds) precision,
* Pause and resume timers and stopwatches.

**HomeyScript**

In addition to the available flow cards, timers and stopwatches can also be controlled using [HomeyScript](https://homeyscript.homey.app).
For example, this script will stop all running timers:

```javascript
let app = await Homey.apps.getApp({id:'nl.fellownet.chronograph'});
app.apiGet('/timers').then(result => {
	let timers = JSON.parse(result);
	timers.forEach(timer => {
		app.apiDelete('/timers/' + timer.id);
	});
});
```

* GET /timers - retrieve a list of all active timers,
* GET /timers/<id> - retrieve a single timer,
* PUT /timers/<id> - pause or resume a timer,
* DELETE /timers/<id> - stops a timer.
* GET /stopwatches - retrieve a list of all active timers,
* GET /stopwatches/<id> - retrieve a single timer,
* PUT /stopwatches/<id> - pause or resume a timer,
* DELETE /stopwatches/<id> - stops a timer.
